This Readme will cover the question and answer for the assessment.

EXTRACTOR

Q1 How does this code satisfy the requirements for the Extractor?

A1 This code satisfies the requirements for the Extractor by extracting the data from the given URL and storing it in a CSV file. The code uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract the required data.

```python
def extract_content(soup):
    title = soup.title.string if soup.title else "No Title"
    content = ""
    
    # Extract meaningful content (subtitles and paragraphs)
    for tag in soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'p']):
        content += tag.get_text() + "\n"
    
    return title, content
```

The `extract_content` function extracts the title and content of the webpage by parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. It extracts the title of the webpage from the `<title>` tag and the meaningful content from the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`, and `<p>` tags. 

```python
ef make_summary(text, ratio=0.1, max_sentences=10):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    num_sentences = max(1, int(len(sentences) * ratio))

    # Ensure the number of sentences does not exceed the maximum
    while num_sentences > max_sentences and ratio > 0:
        ratio -= 0.01
        num_sentences = max(1, int(len(sentences) * ratio))

    # Text into words
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())

    # Removing stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.casefold() not in stop_words]

    # Calculate word frequencies
    fdist = FreqDist(filtered_words)

    # Assign scores to sentences based on word frequencies
    sentence_scores = [sum(fdist[word] for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) if word in fdist)
                       for sentence in sentences]

    # Create a list of tuples containing sentence index and score
    sentence_scores = list(enumerate(sentence_scores))

    # Sort sentences by scores in descending order
    sorted_sentences = sorted(sentence_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Select the top `num_sentences` sentences for the summary
    summary_sentences = sorted(sorted_sentences[:num_sentences], key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Create the summary
    summary = ' '.join([sentences[i].replace('\n', ' ').replace('\n\n', ' ') for i, _ in summary_sentences])

    return summary
```

The `make_summary` function generates a summary of the extracted content by tokenizing the text into sentences and words, removing stop words, calculating word frequencies, assigning scores to sentences based on word frequencies, and selecting the top sentences for the summary. It then scores the sentences based on the word frequencies and selects the top sentences for the summary based on the given ratio and maximum number of sentences.

The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file using the pandas library. The code also handles exceptions and errors that may occur during the extraction process.

Q2 How is the API scalable?

A2. The API is scalable using asynchronous programming with the FastAPI framework. The FastAPI framework allows for the creation of high-performance APIs with minimal code and overhead. By using asynchronous programming with FastAPI, the API can handle multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and scalability. On top of that, there is multi-threading and multi-processing to handle multiple requests concurrently inside the service layer for faster processing. The parallel processing is done using a task queue to handle long-running tasks asynchronously. 

Q3 What are some other methods achieved to improve the API?

A3 Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API based on the remote IP address. The API also includes error handling to provide informative error messages to the users in case of any issues. The API is also secured using API keys to authenticate and authorize users. The API is also documented using Swagger UI to provide a user-friendly interface for testing and exploring the API endpoints.

Q4 How can it be improved?

The API can also be improved by adding caching mechanisms to store the results of previous requests and reduce the load on the server. The concurrent feature from python can be used to handle multiple requests concurrently. 

CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP

Q1 How does this code satisfy the requirements for the Causal Relationship Visualizer?

A1 This code satisfies the requirements for the Causal Relationship Visualizer by extracting the causal relationships from the given text and visualizing them using a directed graph. The code uses the following method to compare the texts and find a similarity score between them.

```python

def compare_corpora(corpus1, corpus2) -> float:
    # Ensure both corpus inputs are strings
    if not isinstance(corpus1, str):
        corpus1 = str(corpus1)
    if not isinstance(corpus2, str):
        corpus2 = str(corpus2)

    logging.info(f"Comparing corpora: {corpus1[:100]}... and {corpus2[:100]}...")
    logging.info(f"Type of corpus1: {type(corpus1)}, Type of corpus2: {type(corpus2)}")

    # Write the corpora to temporary files to ensure compatibility with the corpus similarity module
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".txt") as temp1, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".txt") as temp2:
        temp1.write(corpus1.encode('utf-8'))
        temp2.write(corpus2.encode('utf-8'))
        temp1_path = temp1.name
        temp2_path = temp2.name

    result = cs.calculate(temp1_path, temp2_path)

    # Clean up temporary files
    os.remove(temp1_path)
    os.remove(temp2_path)

    # Replace NaN with None (or a default value) so JSON can serialize it
    import math
    if result is None or (isinstance(result, float) and math.isnan(result)):
        result = None

    return result
```

The `compare_corpora` function compares two corpora by calculating the similarity score between them using the corpus similarity module. The similarity score is then used to determine the causal relationships between the texts. The basis is that if two texts are similar, then they are causally related. The causal relationships are visualized using a directed graph, where the nodes represent the texts and the edges represent the causal relationships between them.

The endpoint /query-pairwise-causal/ returns the causal relationships between the texts in a pairwise manner. This is then parsed into a graph and then displayed in the streamlit application. 

CLUSTERING

Q1 How does this code satisfy the requirements for the Clustering?

There are two types of clustering implemented in the code. The first one is the Hierarchical clustering based on te and the second one is the Hierarchical clustering. The Hierarchical clustering is implemented using the AgglomerativeClustering algorithm from the scikit-learn library. The code uses the following method to perform hierarchical clustering on the given data.

```python
def run_hierarchical_clustering():
    try:
        # Query data
        json_data = sanitize_correlation(query_all_correlations())

        # Convert correlations to distances
        distance_matrix = convert_to_distance_matrix(json_data)

        # Perform hierarchical clustering
        Z = perform_hierarchical_clustering(distance_matrix)

        # NEW: Build id_title mapping from printed_data.csv
        df = pd.read_csv("printed_data.csv")
        id_title = dict(enumerate(df["Title"].tolist()))
        
        # Call updated visualization with custom labels
        visualize_dendrogram(Z, id_title)
        
        logger.info("Hierarchical clustering completed.")
        return {"message": "Hierarchical clustering completed."}
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in hierarchical clustering: {e}")
        raise
```

The `run_hierarchical_clustering` function queries the data, converts the correlations to distances, performs hierarchical clustering, and visualizes the dendrogram using the AgglomerativeClustering algorithm. The hierarchical clustering is based on the distance matrix calculated from the correlations between the data points. The dendrogram is visualized using the scipy library and the matplotlib library.

The second clustering is the LDA clustering. The LDA clustering is implemented using the LatentDirichletAllocation algorithm from the scikit-learn library. The code uses the following method to perform LDA clustering on the given data. This however does not use the correlation scores but rather the raw texts corpus themselves. The LDA clustering is based on the text data and the number of topics specified by the user. The LDA clustering is used to group the text data into topics based on the latent topics present in the data.

```python
def run_lda_clustering(n_topics: int = 5):
    lda = LDA(n_topics=n_topics, max_iter=10, random_state=42)
    # Query data
    corpora = query_all_corpora()
    # Extract texts and ids using correct keys from neo4j query
    corpus = [doc["text"] for doc in corpora]
    ids = [doc["id"] for doc in corpora]
    # Run LDA clustering
    lda.run(corpus, ids)
    logger.info(f"LDA clustering completed with {n_topics} topics.")
    return {"message": f"LDA clustering completed with {n_topics} topics."}
```

The `run_lda_clustering` function queries the data, extracts the texts and ids, and runs the LDA clustering algorithm on the text data. The LDA clustering is based on the number of topics specified by the user and the latent topics present in the data. The LDA clustering is used to group the text data into topics based on the latent topics present in the data.

Q2. Justification for choosing the hierarchical clustering and LDA clustering.

A2. Hierarchical clustering is chosen for the clustering task because it is a powerful method for grouping data points based on their similarity or distance. Since the correlation scores are already calculated, the hierarchical clustering can be performed based on the distance matrix calculated from the correlations. The hierarchical clustering provides a visual representation of the clusters in the form of a dendrogram, which can help in understanding the relationships between the data points.

On the other hand, a more accurate method for clustering is done using the LDA clustering, which is a generative probabilistic model that assigns topics to text data based on the latent topics present in the data. its time however increases a lot with the increase in the number of documents.
